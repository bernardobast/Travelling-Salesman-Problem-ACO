# Travelling-Salesman-Problem-ACO
This project was developed in the context of Object-Oriented Programing where an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm was developed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).  The TSP problem consists of finding the shortest and most effective path that goes through all the nodes in a graph. Once the program is finished, the shortest path is printed.
